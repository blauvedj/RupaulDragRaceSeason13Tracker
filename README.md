# RupaulDragRaceSeason13Tracker Our fantasy league operates on the principle that each week a player can pick 3 queens, and change them from week to week. 
#to use this tracker simply download the excel file Drag_Rankings_Season13_tracker.xlsx. On Tab one, each week, enter points for the drag queens as they win mini challenges or are in the top.
# on the second tab, the players pick their three queens using the drop downs, and the scores will automatically populate; the third tab automatically tracks the total for all the weeks.
# Thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race Fantasy FOR YOUR LIFE for the format, you can find their great sheet here at
